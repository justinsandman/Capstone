# **Fuel Train Develop (FTD)** 

For our 2025 Computer Science Capstone, we are developing a comprehensive, web-based health and fitness tracker. The final product will allow users to log dietary, exercise, and lifestyle choices. As student-athletes, we value healthy living and want to help others on their wellness journey. We have chosen a web-based platform instead of a phone-based app to provide a greater level of accessibility across devices. 

While many fitness trackers require subscriptions for advanced features, our project will offer these tools free of charge. The application will have three layers: a frontend, a middle layer for communication, and a backend. We have chosen Tailwind CSS for the user interface, Python for backend communication, and MySQL for database management. To guide our design, we are using Figma to create a working prototype.

Our goal is to support users of all experience levels by providing an easy-to-use, accessible tool for tracking health and lifestyle habits. With a clean interface and intuitive features, our tracker will make monitoring progress simple and engaging, empowering users to make informed, healthier choices.
